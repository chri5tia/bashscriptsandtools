# Bash scripts and tools examples, adapted from specific projects

# To activate scripts and script menu, make a copy of scripts by removing .master
# name extension, customize as needed per server in the "one-time customization" 
# or "define variables" section.

# At each git pull, remove customized scripts and create new files without the .master
# TODO: find a way around losing customizations when updating scripts

# .gitignore should be set to ignore all scripts that do not end in .master

# Example scripts are adapted from tested, but adaptations are untested.
